## Project Organization

This GitHub repository contains all the materials and codes of my final project for the exam of the **Computational Fluid Dynamics** course of the **Scientific and Data-Intensive Computing** master degree at *Università degli Studi di Trieste* & *SISSA* (2023-2024).

The comprehensive report detailing the entire project can be found in the file `Report/Zappi_CFD_report.pdf`. The project focuses on the study and the simulation of two classic fluid dynamics problems: the **2D lid-driven cavity flow** and the **2D Poiseuille flow**.

The `Lid_Driven_Cavity_SMAC` folder contains the code I implemented to simulate the lid-driven cavity flow using the simplified marker and cell (S-MAC) method; the code was written in both `Python` and `MATLAB`: both versions are available.

The scripts and configurations files I employed to simulate the lid-driven cavity flow using OpenFoam can be found in the `Lid_Driven_Cavity_OpenFoam` folder, while the ones I used for the Poiseuille flow are all located in the `Poiseuille_flow_OpenFoam` folder.
